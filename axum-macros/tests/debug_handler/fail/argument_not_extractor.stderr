error[E0277]: the trait bound `bool: FromRequestParts<()>` is not satisfied

  = help: the following other types implement trait `FromRequestParts<S>`:
            <() as FromRequestParts<S>>
            <(T1, T2) as FromRequestParts<S>>
            <(T1, T2, T3) as FromRequestParts<S>>

          and 25 others
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `FromRequest<(), Body, axum_core::extract::private::ViaParts>` for `bool`
note: required by a bound in `__axum_macros_check_handler_0_0_from_request_check`
