  = help: the following other types implement trait `FromRequestParts<S>`:
            <Extractor as FromRequestParts<S>>
            <HeaderMap as FromRequestParts<S>>
            <Extension<T> as FromRequestParts<S>>
            <Method as FromRequestParts<S>>
            <axum::http::request::Parts as FromRequestParts<S>>

            <Version as FromRequestParts<S>>
            <Extensions as FromRequestParts<S>>
          and $N others
