//! Based on tokio-tungstenite example websocket client, but with multiple
//! concurrent websocket clients in one package
//!
//! This will connect to a server specified in the SERVER with N_CLIENTS
//! concurrent connections, and then flood some test messages over websocket.
//! This will also print whatever it gets into stdout.
//!
//! Note that this is not currently optimized for performance, especially around
//! stdout mutex management. Rather it's intended to show an example of working with axum's
//! websocket server and how the client-side and server-side code can be quite similar.
