/// Types that can be created from requests.
///
/// See [`axum::extract`] for more details.
///
/// # What is the `B` type parameter?
///
/// `FromRequest` is generic over the request body (the `B` in
/// [`http::Request<B>`]). This is to allow `FromRequest` to be usable with any
/// type of request body. This is necessary because some middleware change the
/// request body, for example to add timeouts.
///
/// If you're writing your own `FromRequest` that wont be used outside your
/// application, and not using any middleware that changes the request body, you
/// can most likely use `axum::body::Body`.
///
/// If you're writing a library that's intended for others to use, it's recommended
/// to keep the generic type parameter:
///
/// ```rust
/// use axum::{
///     async_trait,
///     extract::{FromRequest, RequestParts},
/// };
///
/// struct MyExtractor;
///
/// #[async_trait]
/// impl<B> FromRequest<B> for MyExtractor
/// where
///     B: Send, // required by `async_trait`
/// {
///     type Rejection = http::StatusCode;
///
///     async fn from_request(req: &mut RequestParts<B>) -> Result<Self, Self::Rejection> {
///         // ...
///         # unimplemented!()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This ensures your extractor is as flexible as possible.
///
