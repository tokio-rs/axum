# 0.2.4 (02. May, 2022)

- **added:** Implement `IntoResponse` and `IntoResponseParts` for `http::Extensions` ([#975])
- **added:** Implement `IntoResponse` for `(http::response::Parts, impl IntoResponse)` ([#950])
- **added:** Implement `IntoResponse` for `(http::response::Response<()>, impl IntoResponse)` ([#950])
- **added:** Implement `IntoResponse for (Parts | Request<()>, $(impl IntoResponseParts)+, impl IntoResponse)` ([#980])

[#980]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/pull/980

# 0.2.3 (25. April, 2022)

- **added:** Add `response::ErrorResponse` and `response::Result` for
  `IntoResponse`-based error handling ([#921])

[#921]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/pull/921 

# 0.2.2 (19. April, 2022)

- **added:** Add `AppendHeaders` for appending headers to a response rather than overriding them ([#927])

[#927]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/pull/927

# 0.2.1 (03. April, 2022)

- **added:** Add `RequestParts::extract` which allows applying an extractor as a method call ([#897])

[#897]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/pull/897

# 0.2.0 (31. March, 2022)

- **added:** Add `IntoResponseParts` trait which allows defining custom response
  types for adding headers or extensions to responses ([#797])
- **breaking:** Using `HeaderMap` as an extractor will no longer remove the headers and thus
  they'll still be accessible to other extractors, such as `axum::extract::Json`. Instead
  `HeaderMap` will clone the headers. You should prefer to use `TypedHeader` to extract only the
  headers you need ([#698])

  This includes these breaking changes:
    - `RequestParts::take_headers` has been removed.
    - `RequestParts::headers` returns `&HeaderMap`.
    - `RequestParts::headers_mut` returns `&mut HeaderMap`.
    - `HeadersAlreadyExtracted` has been removed.
    - The `HeadersAlreadyExtracted` variant has been removed from these rejections:
        - `RequestAlreadyExtracted`
        - `RequestPartsAlreadyExtracted`
    - `<HeaderMap as FromRequest<_>>::Rejection` has been changed to `std::convert::Infallible`.
- **breaking:** `axum::http::Extensions` is no longer an extractor (ie it
  doesn't implement `FromRequest`). The `axum::extract::Extension` extractor is
  _not_ impacted by this and works the same. This change makes it harder to
  accidentally remove all extensions which would result in confusing errors
  elsewhere ([#699])
  This includes these breaking changes:
    - `RequestParts::take_extensions` has been removed.
    - `RequestParts::extensions` returns `&Extensions`.
    - `RequestParts::extensions_mut` returns `&mut Extensions`.
    - `RequestAlreadyExtracted` has been removed.
    - `<Request as FromRequest>::Rejection` is now `BodyAlreadyExtracted`.
    - `<http::request::Parts as FromRequest>::Rejection` is now `Infallible`.
    - `ExtensionsAlreadyExtracted` has been removed.
- **breaking:** `RequestParts::body_mut` now returns `&mut Option<B>` so the
  body can be swapped ([#869])
