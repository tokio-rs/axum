# Unreleased

- **breaking:** Using `HeaderMap` as an extractor will no longer remove the headers and thus
  they'll still be accessible to other extractors, such as `axum::extract::Json`. Instead
  `HeaderMap` will clone the headers. You should prefer to use `TypedHeader` to extract only the
  headers you need ([#698])

  This includes these breaking changes:
    - `RequestParts::take_headers` has been removed.
    - `RequestParts::headers` returns `&HeaderMap`.
    - `RequestParts::headers_mut` returns `&mut HeaderMap`.
    - `HeadersAlreadyExtracted` has been removed.
    - The `HeadersAlreadyExtracted` variant has been removed from these rejections:
        - `RequestAlreadyExtracted`
        - `RequestPartsAlreadyExtracted`
    - `<HeaderMap as FromRequest<_>>::Error` has been changed to `std::convert::Infallible`.
