error: future cannot be sent between threads safely

  | ^^^^^ future returned by `handler` is not `Send`

  = help: within `impl Future`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<()>`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

6 |     async {}.await;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ await occurs here, with `rc` maybe used later

note: required by a bound in `check`
