//! # High level features
//!
//! - Route requests to handlers with a macro free API.
//! - Declaratively parse requests using extractors.
//! - Simple and predictable error handling model.
//! - Generate responses with minimal boilerplate.
//! - Take full advantage of the [`tower`] and [`tower-http`] ecosystem of
//!   middleware, services, and utilities.
//!
//! In particular the last point is what sets `axum` apart from other frameworks.
//! `axum` doesn't have its own middleware system but instead uses
//! [`tower::Service`]. This means `axum` gets timeouts, tracing, compression,
//! authorization, and more, for free. It also enables you to share middleware with
//! applications written using [`hyper`] or [`tonic`].
//!
//! # Compatibility
//!
//! axum is designed to work with [tokio] and [hyper]. Runtime and
//! transport layer independence is not a goal, at least for the time being.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The "Hello, World!" of axum is:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use axum::{
//!     routing::get,
//!     Router,
//! };
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     // build our application with a single route
//!     let app = Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }));
//!
//!     // run it with hyper on localhost:3000
//!     axum::Server::bind(&"0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap())
//!         .serve(app.into_make_service())
//!         .await
//!         .unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Routing
//!
//! [`Router`] is used to setup which paths goes to which services:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use axum::{Router, routing::get};
//!
//! // our router
//! let app = Router::new()
//!     .route("/", get(root))
//!     .route("/foo", get(get_foo).post(post_foo))
//!     .route("/foo/bar", get(foo_bar));
//!
//! // which calls one of these handlers
//! async fn root() {}
//! async fn get_foo() {}
//! async fn post_foo() {}
//! async fn foo_bar() {}
//! # async {
//! # axum::Server::bind(&"".parse().unwrap()).serve(app.into_make_service()).await.unwrap();
//! # };
//! ```
//!
//! See [`Router`] for more details on routing.
//!
//! # Handlers
//!
#![doc = include_str!("docs/handlers_intro.md")]
//!
//! See [`handler`](crate::handler) for more details on handlers.
//!
//! # Extractors
//!
//! An extractor is a type that implements [`FromRequest`]. Extractors is how
//! you pick apart the incoming request to get the parts your handler needs.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use axum::extract::{Path, Query, Json};
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//!
//! // `Path` gives you the path parameters and deserializes them.
//! async fn path(Path(user_id): Path<u32>) {}
//!
//! // `Query` gives you the query parameters and deserializes them.
//! async fn query(Query(params): Query<HashMap<String, String>>) {}
//!
//! // Buffer the request body and deserialize it as JSON into a
//! // `serde_json::Value`. `Json` supports any type that implements
//! // `serde::Deserialize`.
//! async fn json(Json(payload): Json<serde_json::Value>) {}
//! ```
//!
//! See [`extract`](crate::extract) for more details on extractors.
//!
//! # Responses
//!
//! Anything that implements [`IntoResponse`] can be returned from handlers.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use axum::{
//!     body::Body,
//!     routing::get,
//!     response::Json,
//!     Router,
//! };
//! use serde_json::{Value, json};
//!
//! // `&'static str` becomes a `200 OK` with `content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`
//! async fn plain_text() -> &'static str {
//!     "foo"
//! }
//!
//! // `Json` gives a content-type of `application/json` and works with any type
//! // that implements `serde::Serialize`
//! async fn json() -> Json<Value> {
//!     Json(json!({ "data": 42 }))
//! }
//!
//! let app = Router::new()
//!     .route("/plain_text", get(plain_text))
//!     .route("/json", get(json));
//! # async {
//! # axum::Server::bind(&"".parse().unwrap()).serve(app.into_make_service()).await.unwrap();
//! # };
//! ```
//!
//! See [`response`](crate::response) for more details on building responses.
//!
//! # Error handling
//!
//! axum aims to have a simple and predictable error handling model. That means
//! it is simple to convert errors into responses and you are guaranteed that
//! all errors are handled.
//!
//! See [`error_handling`](crate::error_handling) for more details on axum's
//! error handling model and how to handle errors gracefully.
//!
//! # Middleware
//!
#![doc = include_str!("docs/middleware.md")]
//!
//! # Routing to services and backpressure
//!
//! Generally routing to one of multiple services and backpressure doesn't mix
//! well. Ideally you would want ensure a service is ready to receive a request
//! before calling it. However, in order to know which service to call, you need
//! the request...
//!
//! One approach is to not consider the router service itself ready until all
//! destination services are ready. That is the approach used by
//! [`tower::steer::Steer`].
//!
//! Another approach is to always consider all services ready (always return
//! `Poll::Ready(Ok(()))`) from `Service::poll_ready` and then actually drive
//! readiness inside the response future returned by `Service::call`. This works
//! well when your services don't care about backpressure and are always ready
//! anyway.
//!
//! axum expects that all services used in your app wont care about
//! backpressure and so it uses the latter strategy. However that means you
//! should avoid routing to a service (or using a middleware) that _does_ care
//! about backpressure. At the very least you should [load shed] so requests are
//! dropped quickly and don't keep piling up.
//!
//! It also means that if `poll_ready` returns an error then that error will be
//! returned in the response future from `call` and _not_ from `poll_ready`. In
//! that case, the underlying service will _not_ be discarded and will continue
//! to be used for future requests. Services that expect to be discarded if
//! `poll_ready` fails should _not_ be used with axum.
//!
//! One possible approach is to only apply backpressure sensitive middleware
//! around your entire app. This is possible because axum applications are
//! themselves services:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use axum::{
//!     routing::get,
//!     Router,
//! };
//! use tower::ServiceBuilder;
//! # let some_backpressure_sensitive_middleware =
//! #     tower::layer::util::Identity::new();
//!
//! async fn handler() { /* ... */ }
//!
//! let app = Router::new().route("/", get(handler));
//!
//! let app = ServiceBuilder::new()
//!     .layer(some_backpressure_sensitive_middleware)
//!     .service(app);
//! # async {
//! # axum::Server::bind(&"".parse().unwrap()).serve(app.into_make_service()).await.unwrap();
//! # };
//! ```
//!
//! However when applying middleware around your whole application in this way
//! you have to take care that errors are still being handled with
//! appropriately.
//!
//! Also note that handlers created from async functions don't care about
//! backpressure and are always ready. So if you're not using any Tower
//! middleware you don't have to worry about any of this.
//!
//! # Sharing state with handlers
//!
//! It is common to share some state between handlers for example to share a
//! pool of database connections or clients to other services. That can be done
//! using the [`AddExtension`] middleware (applied with [`AddExtensionLayer`])
//! and the [`Extension`](crate::extract::Extension) extractor:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use axum::{
//!     AddExtensionLayer,
//!     extract::Extension,
//!     routing::get,
//!     Router,
//! };
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! struct State {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! let shared_state = Arc::new(State { /* ... */ });
//!
//! let app = Router::new()
//!     .route("/", get(handler))
//!     .layer(AddExtensionLayer::new(shared_state));
//!
//! async fn handler(
//!     Extension(state): Extension<Arc<State>>,
//! ) {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! # async {
//! # axum::Server::bind(&"".parse().unwrap()).serve(app.into_make_service()).await.unwrap();
//! # };
//! ```
//!
//! # Building integrations for axum
//!
//! Libraries authors that want to provide [`FromRequest`] or [`IntoResponse`] implementations
//! should depend on the [`axum-core`] crate, instead of `axum` if possible. [`axum-core`] contains
//! core types and traits and is less likely to receive breaking changes.
//!
//! # Required dependencies
//!
//! To use axum there are a few dependencies you have pull in as well:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! axum = "<latest-version>"
//! hyper = { version = "<latest-version>", features = ["full"] }
//! tokio = { version = "<latest-version>", features = ["full"] }
//! tower = "<latest-version>"
//! ```
//!
//! The `"full"` feature for hyper and tokio isn't strictly necessary but it's
//! the easiest way to get started.
//!
//! Note that [`hyper::Server`] is re-exported by axum so if thats all you need
//! then you don't have to explicitly depend on hyper.
//!
//! Tower isn't strictly necessary either but helpful for testing. See the
//! testing example in the repo to learn more about testing axum apps.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The axum repo contains [a number of examples][examples] that show how to put all the
//! pieces together.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! axum uses a set of [feature flags] to reduce the amount of compiled and
//! optional dependencies.
//!
//! The following optional features are available:
//!
//! Name | Description | Default?
//! ---|---|---
//! `headers` | Enables extracting typed headers via [`TypedHeader`] | No
//! `http1` | Enables hyper's `http1` feature | Yes
//! `http2` | Enables hyper's `http2` feature | No
//! `json` | Enables the [`Json`] type and some similar convenience functionality | Yes
//! `multipart` | Enables parsing `multipart/form-data` requests with [`Multipart`] | No
//! `tower-log` | Enables `tower`'s `log` feature | Yes
//! `ws` | Enables WebSockets support via [`extract::ws`] | No
