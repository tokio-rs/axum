# awebframework

**WARNING:** awebframework is very much still work in progress. Nothing is released
to crates.io yet and you shouldn't be using this in production.

awebframework (name pending) is a tiny web application framework that focuses on
ergonomics and modularity.

More information about this crate can be found in the [crate documentation][docs].

## Goals

- Ease of use. Building web apps in Rust should be as easy as `async fn
handle(Request) -> Response`.
- Solid foundation. awebframework is built on top of tower and makes it easy to
plug in any middleware from the [tower] and [tower-http] ecosystem.
- Focus on routing, extracting data from requests, and generating responses.
Tower middleware can handle the rest.
- Macro free core. Macro frameworks have their place but awebframework focuses
on providing a core that is macro free.

## Usage example

```rust
use awebframework::prelude::*;
use hyper::Server;
use std::net::SocketAddr;
use tower::make::Shared;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // build our application with a single route
    let app = route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }));

    // run it with hyper on localhost:3000
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(Shared::new(app))
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```
